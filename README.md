🛠️ Key Features


✔ Run AI Models Locally – No cloud dependency, full control over your models.


✔ Docker-Based Deployment – Containerized AI for better scalability and ease of use.


✔ ChatGPT-Like Web UI – Seamless user interaction through image-web-ui.


✔ WSL Integration – Bringing a Linux-powered development experience to Windows.


✔ Remote Access via ngrok – Secure, temporary exposure of the local AI server to the internet.


✔ Efficient & Cost-Effective – Say goodbye to cloud costs and latency issues.

📌 Why This Project?


With AI models becoming more powerful, self-hosting AI is now a viable alternative to cloud-based solutions. This project is a blueprint for running and interacting with AI on your own machine, offering:


Better Data Privacy – Keep sensitive AI interactions offline.


Lower Costs – No need for expensive cloud GPUs.


Reduced Latency – Process AI requests instantly without relying on external servers.


Enhanced Developer Control – Fine-tune, modify, and integrate models as needed.

###🖥️ Setting Up Your Local AI


1️⃣ Install Ollama


First, install Ollama to manage and run AI models locally.

```curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh```


###2️⃣ Run AI Models via CLI


Once installed, you can directly serve AI models from your command line.


```ollama run <model_name>```


###3️⃣ Deploy AI as a Web UI (Using Docker)


For a ChatGPT-like experience, pull and run the image-web-ui inside Docker.


```
docker pull ghcr.io/<repo>/image-web-ui:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/<repo>/image-web-ui
```


###4️⃣ Enable WSL for a Linux-Like Dev Environment on Windows


WSL seamlessly integrates Linux inside Windows, making AI development smooth and efficient.


```wsl --install```


Once WSL is set up, you can run AI models inside a Linux terminal on Windows, unlocking better compatibility and performance.


###5️⃣ Make Your AI Public with ngrok (Optional)


Want to access your AI remotely? Use ngrok to expose your local server.


```ngrok http 3000```


This will generate a public URL, allowing you to access your AI model from any device.

📈 The Future of Local AI


The ability to run AI models efficiently without the cloud is a game-changer. Whether for research, personal projects, or enterprise applications, self-hosting AI provides unparalleled flexibility.


This is just the beginning. The future of AI is not just in the cloud—it’s local. 🚀


Let’s build the next-gen AI stack together. 🛠️
